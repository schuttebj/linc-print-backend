# Madagascar License Card Hybrid Storage Implementation

## 🎯 **Implementation Summary**

Successfully implemented the hybrid storage approach for card files with automatic cleanup after QA completion. This eliminates storage bloat while maintaining file availability during the production workflow.

## 📁 **File Storage Structure**

### **Directory Organization**
```
/var/madagascar-license-data/
├── biometric/           # (existing - biometric files)
│   └── YYYY/MM/DD/application_id/
└── cards/               # (new - card files)
    └── YYYY/MM/DD/print_job_id/
        ├── front.png    # Front card image
        ├── back.png     # Back card image  
        ├── front.pdf    # Front card PDF
        ├── back.pdf     # Back card PDF
        └── combined.pdf # Complete card PDF
```

### **File Lifecycle**
```
Print Job Created → Files Generated & Saved to Disk
     ↓
QA Process (files available for inspection)
     ↓
QA PASSED → Files Deleted from Disk (metadata kept)
     ↓
Database updated with cleanup status
```

## 🔧 **Key Components Implemented**

### **1. Card File Manager (`app/services/card_file_manager.py`)**
- **File Storage**: Save card files to organized disk structure
- **File Retrieval**: Get file content for serving to users
- **Lifecycle Management**: Delete files after QA completion
- **Storage Statistics**: Monitor usage and cleanup effectiveness
- **Orphan Cleanup**: Remove files without database records

### **2. Updated Card Generator (`app/services/card_generator.py`)**
- **Disk Storage**: Files saved to persistent disk instead of database
- **File Paths**: Returns file paths instead of base64 data
- **Metadata**: Tracks file sizes and generation info
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if file operations fail

### **3. Enhanced Print Job CRUD (`app/crud/crud_printing.py`)**
- **File Integration**: Print jobs automatically generate and save files
- **QA Completion**: Files deleted when QA passes, kept when QA fails
- **Cleanup Tracking**: Database metadata tracks file deletion status
- **Reprint Support**: Failed QA jobs keep files for reprint processing

### **4. Updated API Endpoints (`app/api/v1/endpoints/printing.py`)**
- **File Serving**: Serve files from disk with proper error handling
- **Storage Management**: Statistics and cleanup endpoints
- **QA Integration**: Automatic file cleanup on QA completion
- **Error Messages**: Clear messages when files are deleted/unavailable

## 📊 **Storage Efficiency Results**

### **Before (Database Storage)**
```
150,000 cards/year × 3.2 MB = 480 GB/year
Growing storage: 2.4 TB after 5 years
```

### **After (Hybrid Approach)**
```
Files kept during production workflow only
Deleted after QA completion
Steady state: ~40 GB (1-2 weeks of active jobs)
Annual growth: Minimal (uncollected jobs eliminated)
```

### **Storage Savings: 92% reduction**

## 🔄 **Workflow Integration**

### **Card Production Workflow**
1. **QUEUED → ASSIGNED**: Files available on disk
2. **PRINTING → PRINTED**: Files available for production
3. **QUALITY_CHECK**: Files available for QA inspection
4. **QA PASSED → COMPLETED**: **Files automatically deleted**
5. **QA FAILED → REPRINT**: Files kept for reprint process

### **File Availability**
- ✅ **Available**: During print production and QA process
- ✅ **Available**: For reprint jobs (QA failed)
- ❌ **Deleted**: After successful QA completion
- ❌ **Deleted**: After reprint QA passes

## 🛠️ **API Endpoints**

### **File Access**
```
GET /api/v1/printing/jobs/{id}/files/front         # Front card PNG
GET /api/v1/printing/jobs/{id}/files/back          # Back card PNG  
GET /api/v1/printing/jobs/{id}/files/combined-pdf  # Complete PDF
```

### **Storage Management**
```
GET  /api/v1/printing/storage/statistics           # Usage statistics
POST /api/v1/printing/storage/cleanup-orphaned     # Clean orphaned files
```

### **Error Handling**
- **404**: Files not generated
- **410**: Files deleted after QA completion
- **500**: File system errors

## 📈 **Monitoring & Statistics**

### **Storage Statistics Endpoint**
```json
{
  "storage_usage": {
    "total_size_gb": 2.3,
    "total_files": 1247,
    "total_print_jobs": 249,
    "average_size_per_job_mb": 3.2
  },
  "database_statistics": {
    "total_print_jobs": 1500,
    "jobs_with_files_on_disk": 249,
    "jobs_files_deleted_after_qa": 1251,
    "cleanup_rate_percent": 83.4,
    "storage_efficiency_percent": 83.4
  },
  "hybrid_approach_metrics": {
    "files_cleaned_up": 1251,
    "storage_saved_estimate_gb": 3.9,
    "description": "Files are deleted after QA completion"
  }
}
```

### **Key Metrics**
- **Cleanup Rate**: % of jobs with files deleted after QA
- **Storage Efficiency**: % reduction in storage usage
- **Active Files**: Files currently on disk
- **Storage Health**: Overall system health indicator

## 🔧 **Database Schema Updates**

### **PrintJob Model Changes**
```python
# File paths (not base64 content)
pdf_front_path = Column(String(500), nullable=True)
pdf_back_path = Column(String(500), nullable=True) 
pdf_combined_path = Column(String(500), nullable=True)

# Enhanced metadata with cleanup tracking
generation_metadata = Column(JSON, nullable=True)
# Tracks: file sizes, generation time, cleanup status

# Deprecated field (kept for compatibility)
card_files_data = Column(JSON, nullable=True)
# Note: No longer stores base64 data
```

### **Metadata Structure**
```json
{
  "generator_version": "1.0-MG-PROD",
  "generation_timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "files_saved_to_disk": true,
  "files_deleted_after_qa": true,

    "front_image_bytes": 524288,
    "back_image_bytes": 524288,
    "combined_pdf_bytes": 1048576
  },
  "cleanup_result": {
    "files_deleted": 5,
    "bytes_freed": 3355443
  }
}
```

## 🚀 **Implementation Benefits**

### **Storage Optimization**
- ✅ **92% storage reduction** compared to keeping all files
- ✅ **Predictable storage growth** (~40 GB steady state)
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** eliminates manual maintenance
- ✅ **No uncollected card bloat** (files deleted after QA)

### **Performance Improvements**
- ✅ **Faster database operations** (no large JSON fields)
- ✅ **Efficient file serving** directly from disk
- ✅ **Reduced backup size** and faster backup/restore
- ✅ **Better memory usage** for large queries

### **Operational Excellence**
- ✅ **Files available when needed** (during production workflow)
- ✅ **Clean separation** of concerns (DB for metadata, disk for files)
- ✅ **Monitoring and statistics** for storage health
- ✅ **Orphan cleanup** prevents disk waste

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Scenarios**

#### **"Files deleted after QA completion" (HTTP 410)**
- **Expected behavior** when accessing files for completed jobs
- Files are automatically deleted after successful QA
- Database record and metadata remain for audit trail

#### **"Card files not found on disk" (HTTP 404)**
- Check file generation status in print job metadata
- Verify print job ID and creation date
- Run orphan cleanup if files may be orphaned

#### **Storage growing unexpectedly**
- Check cleanup rate in storage statistics
- Verify QA completion is triggering file deletion
- Look for jobs stuck in QUALITY_CHECK status

### **Maintenance Operations**

#### **Manual File Cleanup** (if needed)
```bash
# Clean up orphaned files
curl -X POST /api/v1/printing/storage/cleanup-orphaned
```

#### **Storage Monitoring**
```bash
# Get current storage statistics
curl -X GET /api/v1/printing/storage/statistics
```

## 📋 **Migration Notes**

### **From Database Storage**
- Existing print jobs with `card_files_data` continue to work
- New print jobs automatically use disk storage
- Gradual migration as old jobs complete QA
- No data loss during transition

### **Production Deployment**
1. Deploy new code with file manager
2. Ensure `/var/madagascar-license-data/cards/` directory exists
3. Set proper permissions for file operations
4. Monitor storage statistics after deployment
5. Run orphan cleanup periodically

## ✅ **Success Criteria Met**

- ✅ **Hybrid approach implemented** with QA-triggered cleanup
- ✅ **Storage requirements optimized** (92% reduction)
- ✅ **Files available during production** workflow
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** eliminates maintenance
- ✅ **Monitoring and statistics** for operational visibility
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** with existing system
- ✅ **Production-ready** with error handling and logging

## 🎯 **Result**

The hybrid storage approach successfully addresses all requirements:
- **Storage Efficiency**: 40 GB steady state vs 480 GB/year growth
- **Workflow Integration**: Files available when needed, deleted when not
- **Zero Maintenance**: Automatic cleanup based on QA completion
- **Performance**: Fast file serving and lean database operations
- **Monitoring**: Complete visibility into storage health and efficiency

**The system is now optimized for high-volume card production with minimal storage overhead.**
